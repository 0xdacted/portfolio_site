# Personal Website

## Overview
This repository houses the codebase for my personal website built with a modern tech stack. It features over 175 detailed pages, each one dedicated to a specific piece of content, categorized in one of five sections I am passionate about: Movies, Directors, Books, and Authors. In addition to the rich content, the website also boasts dynamic content filtering and sorting capabilities, a responsive design, and project-specific frontends to deliver a seamless user experience.

## Tech Stack
The website is built using the following technologies:

**TypeScript**: For static typing and easy debugging.

**Node.js**: The runtime environment for the server-side JavaScript.

**Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

**Figma**: Used for designing and prototyping the website.

**Redux**: A Predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

**Netlify**: For continuous deployment and hosting of the website.

**Heroku**: Used for application deployment, scaling, and management.
